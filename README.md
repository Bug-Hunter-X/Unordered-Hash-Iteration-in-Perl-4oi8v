This example demonstrates a common, yet often subtle, bug in Perl related to the iteration order of hashes. Perl does not guarantee any specific order when iterating through a hash's keys.  The code in `bug.pl` shows a foreach loop iterating over hash keys. The output of this code is unpredictable because the order of keys is undefined. The solution in `bugSolution.pl` offers alternative approaches to maintain order if needed.
